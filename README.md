# StaticDictionaries üìö
Simple high performance solution for data hardcoding.
Smart. Flexible. Powerful.

Powered by source generators. Without using reflection ‚ùå

StaticDictionaries is a convinient library for data hardcoding in your project.
Just describe the `enum` using attributes, the source generator will do the rest for you.
Minimum code and time spent - maximum result and performance. Property management has never been so convenient.
Helper methods for managing `enum` without reflection will make development pleasant and faster than ever.

## Installing StaticDictionaries

StaticDictionaries is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StaticDictionaries).

```
dotnet add package StaticDictionaries

Install-Package StaticDictionaries
```

## Powerful `enum` management ü¶æ

Source generator creates some methods in [EnumName]Extensions class for convenient and fast `enum` management:

* `Length` quantity of all enum members.
* `MinId` returns min `Id()`.
* `MaxId` returns max `Id()`.
* `All()` returns an array of all `enum` members.
* `GetById()` returns member or `NotSupportedException`.
* `ToJson()` returns serialized `enum`.

## Dictionary supported primitive types üóø

|  CLR type  | Status | 
|------------|-------|
| `int`   |‚úÖ|
| `bool`   |‚úÖ|
| `char`   |‚úÖ|
| `double`   |‚úÖ|
| `decimal`   |‚úÖ|
| `string`   |‚úÖ|

## Samples ü§ù

Employee dictionary with `Name`, `Age` and `Active` properties:
```csharp
[StaticDictionary("Name", "Age", "Active")]
public enum Employee
{
    [Value("Maxim Jhonson", 18, true)]
    Maxim = 1,
    [Value("John Jhonson", 23, false)]
    John = 2
}

public static void Main()
{
    int johnAge = Employee.John.Age();
    int maximAge = Employee.Maxim.Age();
    
    string johnName = Employee.John.Name();
    string maximName = Employee.Maxim.Name();
}

```
Source generator creates [EnumName]Extensions class that provide some powerful functionality for managing your `enum`:
```csharp
[StaticDictionary("Name", "IsLast")]
public enum Status
{
    [Value("New state", false)]
    New = 1,
    [Value("In progress", false)]
    InProgress = 2,
    [Value("In progress", true)]
    Completed = 3
}

public static void Main()
{
    Status status = StatusExtensions.GetById(2);
    
    Status[] statuses = StatusExtensions
                      .All()
                      .Where(x => !x.IsLast())
                      .ToArray();
}

```
`Id()` and `Name()` methods generated by default if you not override them.
```csharp
[StaticDictionary]
public enum Metal
{
    Gold = 1,
    Ferrum = 2
}

public static void Main()
{
    int goldId = Metal.Gold.Id(); 
    string ferrumName = Metal.Ferrum.Name();
}

```

## Important notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

* `StaticDictionary` parameter names must not be duplicated.
* `StaticDictionary` parameter names must use only the English alphabet because they will be generated into methods.
* All `Value` attrubutes must contain such arguments quantity as `StaticDictionary`.
* All `StaticDictionary` `enum` members must contain `Value` attribute with arguments. 
* By default generator creates two methods: `Id()` with `(int)member` and `Name()` with `nameof(member)` if you not override them.
* `enum` members without `Value` attribute will be ignored.
* Parameter types are determined automatically, so all parameters in a sequence must be of the same type.
For example, all first types should be `string`, and all second types should be `bool`.
