# StaticDictionaries üìö
Simple high performance solution for data hardcoding.
Smart. Flexible. Powerful.

Powered by source generators. Without using reflection ‚ùå

StaticDictionaries is a convinient library for data hardcoding in your project.
Just describe the `enum` using attributes, the source generator will do the rest for you.
Minimum code and time spent - maximum result and performance. Property management has never been so convenient.
Helper methods for managing `enum` without reflection will make development pleasant and faster than ever.

## Installing StaticDictionaries

StaticDictionaries is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StaticDictionaries).

|------------|-------|
| `int`   |‚úÖ|
| `bool`   |‚úÖ|
| `char`   |‚úÖ|

## Samples

```csharp
[StaticDictionary("Name", "Age", "Active")]
public enum Employee
{
    [Value("Maxim Jhonson", 18, true)]
    Maxim = 1,
    [Value("John Jhonson", 23, false)]
    John = 2
}

public static void Main()
{
    int johnAge = Employee.John.Age();
    int maximAge = Employee.Maxim.Age();
    
    string johnName = Employee.John.Name();
    string maximName = Employee.Maxim.Name();
}

```

```csharp
[StaticDictionary("Name", "IsLast")]
public enum Status
{
    [Value("New state", false)]
    New = 1,
    [Value("In progress", false)]
    InProgress = 2,
    [Value("In progress", true)]
    Completed = 3
}

public static void Main()
{
    Status status = StatusExtensions.GetById(2);
    
    Status[] statuses = StatusExtensions
                      .All()
                      .Where(x => !x.IsLast())
                      .ToArray();
}

```
```csharp
[StaticDictionary]
public enum Metal
{
    Gold = 1,
    Ferrum = 2
}

public static void Main()
{
    int goldId = Metal.Gold.Id(); 
    string ferrumName = Metal.Ferrum.Name();
}

```

## Important notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

* `StaticDictionary` parameter names must not be duplicated.
* `StaticDictionary` parameter names must be non empty and use only the english alphabet because they will be generated into methods.
* All `Value` attrubutes must contain such parameters quantity as `StaticDictionary`.
* All `StaticDictionary` `enum` members must either all contain `Value` attribute or all not contain it. If the attribute `Value` is not used, the generator creates two methods: `Id()` with member Id and `Name()` with `nameof(member)`.
* Parameter types are determined automatically, so all parameters in a sequence must be of the same type.
For example, all first types should be `string`, and all second types should be `bool`.
* `StaticDictionary` attribute reserves key-word `Id`, this name will converted into `Id()` method with `int` member identifier.
* If you not override `Name` property it will generated by default with `nameof(member)`.
